This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  The error occurs when the route attempts to parse a non-numeric user ID as an integer, potentially causing unexpected behavior or crashes. The solution adds checks to ensure the user ID is valid before proceeding, improving the application's reliability and robustness.
